Okay it looks like you got the function graphed and found the gradient function. I'd like to see you call self-authored functions a notebook or another program and plot the data. MATLAB coding awaits as well.

Took another look, you're making progess, slowly. I still like to see some MATLAB code come out of your work, too. I still haven't seen you around my office, and I'd like to hear more updates from you.
